The Java Collections Framework consists of:
1. Collection interfaces
	Collection, List, Set, Map, etc.
2. General-purpose implementations
	ArrayList, LinkedList, HashSet, HashMap, etc.
3. Special-purpose implementations
	designed for performance characteristics, usage restrictions, or behavior
4. Concurrent implementations
	designed for use in high-concurrency contexts
5. Wrapper implementations
	adding synchronization, immutability, etc.
6. Abstract implementations
	building blocks for custom implementations
7. Algorithms
	static methods that perform useful functions, such as sorting or randomizing a collection
8. Infrastructure
	interfaces to support the collections
9. Array utilities
	static methods that perform useful functions on arrays, such as sorting, initializing, or converting to collections
